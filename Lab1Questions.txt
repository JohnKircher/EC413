Q3
uchar1 is an unsigned character and schar1 is a signed cahracter, so they have different output values.
uchar1 is larger than schar1
I expected the result of -3 because the signed decimal equivalent of FE and FF is -1 and -2 so the sum should be -3.
I expected the result of 509 becaused the unsigned decimale equivalent of FE and FF is 254 and 255 so the sum should be 509.
The result was 254.

The size of a data type boolean is 4

Q5
Shifting with i = 1 to the right moved char from 15 to 30
Shifting with i = 1 to the left moved char from 15 to 7
Shifting with i > 3 to the left moved char from 15 to 0
Shifting with i > 7 to the left moved char from 15 to 0

Q6
Printing the pointer values themselves returns large numbers. %x makes it easier to understand the value because hex is simper for larger numbers.
The difference between ip and ip+1 is the difference between memory addresses and not simply a single increase in the value in the address.

Q8
The bye value after the last character is zero. It is zero because there is no data in that location.

Adding 60 to last byte results in 'HAL<'
