--------

Output from first run:

The sorted array is
	1234

------

Variable count starts in temporary address $t0, count is loaded into $t6 later as a loop counter.  

variable msg starts in arguments address $a0

------

Right before the sort loop call, the program is loading the word from $1 + 44 to $8

However before this line the program also adds constants to signed integers, it also
loads $t1 with the address of array numbs, and initializes $t0 as a counter

------

With the breakpoint at noswap, when looping through, $t1 which stores the array numbs changes as follows:

0,4,8,c,0,4,8,c,0,4,8,c,0,4,8,c,10

-------

After changing count to 8 the output was:

12345678

Description of Program Changes:

In the .asm file I changed the 4 following the count declaration to an 8.
